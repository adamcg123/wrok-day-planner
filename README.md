# work day planner
## Deployed Link To The Planner

##How Does It Work?
It works by using the moment.js api and JQuery to set up for the day. This planner saves your
plans that you have to local storage so even if you close the page and go back to it you wont lose what you had, 
you can also delete what you had in the time block by just deleting the text and hitting save. 
Depending on the time block that you typed your plans into the color of it will change, green means that you have a couple hours.
red means that its the current hour and grey means the past hours.

##Tech Used
local storage, JQuery, javascript, moment.js, css html

##On Startup
when you first use this every time block will be grey.
But when you use it throughout the day it will start to look like the Gif below
